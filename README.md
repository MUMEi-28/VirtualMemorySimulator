# Virtual Memory Simulator

## 📌 Overview

This project is a Unity-based simulation program that demonstrates the concepts of **Page Replacement Algorithms**:  
- **FIFO** (First In First Out)  
- **LRU** (Least Recently Used)  
- **OPT** (Optimal Replacement)

---

## 🎮 How to Play
- Select the **number of page frames** and **reference string length** at the start.
- Press the **Generate** Button.
- Press the **Simulate** Button.
- Choose an algorithm (**FIFO**, **LRU**, or **OPT**) to simulate.
- View the number of page faults and simulation details!

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

### ✅ FIFO (First-In, First-Out)
Replaces the oldest page in memory.

### ✅ LRU (Least Recently Used)
Replaces the page that has not been used for the longest time.

### ✅ OPT (Optimal)
Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future.
